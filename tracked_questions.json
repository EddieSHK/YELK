However, agility requires strong assumptions, including the ability to simplify stakeholder roles, assign projects to small teams, and ensure prompt user interaction. It may also result in less attention to non-functional aspects, environmental assumptions, and documentation. The level of agility can be adjusted by varying the emphasis on different phases of the software engineering cycle.", "Requirement Engineering is the process of understanding, defining, and specifying the requirements of a software-intensive system. These requirements include the system's objectives, functionalities, quality targets, constraints, and assumptions. Requirement Engineering is essential to ensure that the software system meets the needs of the stakeholders and addresses the problems and opportunities of the real-world environment. The Requirement Engineering process involves several activities, including domain understanding, requirements elicitation, evaluation and agreement, specification and documentation, and validation and verification. Domain understanding requires studying the existing system and application domain to identify problems and opportunities. Requirements elicitation involves gathering information from stakeholders to determine their needs and expectations. Evaluation and agreement involves negotiating and resolving conflicting concerns and selecting preferred options. Specification and documentation involves precisely defining the agreed-upon requirements. Validation and verification ensure that the requirements accurately reflect the needs and meet quality standards. Despite advancements in technology, Requirement Engineering remains a challenging and critical aspect of software development. Poor requirement engineering practices can lead to defects, rework, unused features, project chaos, and customer dissatisfaction. Addressing the obstacles to good Requirement Engineering, such as short-term cost pressures and the perceived complexity of requirements documents, is crucial for successful software projects.", "Sustainable development requires close collaboration between business people and developers. Agile development and Rational Engineering (RE) enhance collaboration through principles such as face-to-face communication and self-organizing teams. Agile development can reduce the distance between requirements gathering and coding, facilitating the delivery of functional value to customers. It involves short RE cycles, followed by implementation cycles, with functional increments elicited directly from users. Strong assumptions for agile success include the ability to reduce stakeholder roles to one, assign projects to small teams in a single location, and allow for prompt user interaction. Agility can be adjusted by varying the weight given to different phases of RE cycles, with more weight on elicitation and less on documentation and verification.", "Requirement Engineering (RE) involves understanding the problem and defining the requirements of a software system based on specific objectives, functionalities, constraints, assumptions, and environmental considerations. RE practices ensure that the system correctly solves real-world problems, prioritizing quality assurance. The scope of RE encompasses the \"WHY\" (goals), \"WHAT\" (services), and \"WHO\" (responsibilities) dimensions of the system-to-be. RE involves identifying objectives, defining functionalities, and assigning responsibilities to address system deficiencies, satisfy objectives, and take advantage of technological opportunities. RE categorizes requirements into functional (prescribing intended software effects) and non-functional (constraining how services should be provided, such as security, performance, and usability). Taxonomies further classify non-functional requirements into quality, compliance, architectural, and development constraints. RE processes involve domain understanding, requirements elicitation, evaluation and agreement, specification and documentation, validation and verification, and consolidation. Despite advancements in software technology, poor RE practices remain a significant issue, leading to defects, rework, unused features, and customer dissatisfaction. RE requires ongoing refinement and collaboration between stakeholders to ensure project success and prevent costly errors. Agile development principles encourage incremental and iterative RE, accommodating changing requirements while delivering working software frequently.", "To achieve sustainable and agile development, close collaboration between business and development teams is crucial. Agile methodologies, such as those based on the Twelve Agility Principles, prioritize face-to-face communication, motivated individuals, technical excellence, simplicity, and self-organizing teams. However, agile development in Requirement Engineering (RE) brings unique challenges and assumptions. To overcome these challenges, agile development can reduce the distance between requirements and code, facilitate short RE and implementation cycles, and elicit functional increments directly from users. Despite its advantages, agile development in RE assumes reducible stakeholder roles, small single-location teams, prompt user interaction, and incremental functionality delivery. Furthermore, non-functional aspects and documentation may receive less attention. By carefully balancing the phases of RE cycles, organizations can achieve varying levels of agility in their development processes.", "Requirements Engineering (RE) is a crucial process that defines the objectives, functionalities, constraints, and assumptions of a software-intensive system to ensure it addresses real-world problems. RE involves identifying and analyzing problems and opportunities, defining system objectives and services, assigning responsibilities, and specifying requirements in a formal document. The RE process consists of four phases: domain understanding and elicitation, evaluation and agreement, specification and documentation, and validation and verification. It involves iterative cycles to correct errors and accommodate evolving needs. RE is essential because it reduces defects, rework, unnecessary features, and project chaos, leading to lower costs, better customer satisfaction, and fewer late corrections. However, RE faces obstacles such as uncertain contracts, tight schedules, lack of economic data, and the perception of RDs as complex and outdated. Agile development approaches include RE, recognizing the importance of flexibility and adaptability. Agile principles emphasize customer satisfaction through rapid delivery of useful software and embrace changing requirements. This necessitates frequent communication between stakeholders, including customers and developers, to ensure that requirements remain relevant and adaptable throughout the software development process.", "Agile development, incorporating 12 principles, emphasizes close collaboration between business stakeholders and developers. By fostering a self-organizing, motivated team environment, agile development aims to deliver a constant stream of value to customers. This approach utilizes short feedback loops, prioritizing human interaction and continuously adapting to changing requirements. However, agile development assumes a small, single-location team with the ability to provide functionality incrementally and efficiently. Strong stakeholder alignment, clear roles, and low documentation requirements are also crucial for successful agile implementation. The degree of agility can be tailored by adjusting the weight given to different phases of the requirements engineering cycle.", "Requirements Engineering (RE) is a crucial process that involves gathering, specifying, and managing requirements for software systems. RE activities ensure that the software accurately solves real-world problems by understanding the problem domain, defining objectives, and specifying functional and non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements constrain how services should be provided, including quality attributes (e.g., security, performance, usability) and development constraints (e.g., architecture, process). Taxonomy classifications aid in organizing and analyzing requirements. The RE process consists of four iterative phases: domain understanding and elicitation (gathering requirements from stakeholders), evaluation and agreement (negotiating and prioritizing requirements), specification and documentation (formally defining requirements), and validation and verification (ensuring the requirements meet stakeholder needs). Why is RE important? Poor requirements can lead to significant defects, increased development costs, and user dissatisfaction. Research has shown that requirements-related errors are the most numerous, persistent, and expensive software errors. They can also have severe consequences for safety and security. Despite the importance of RE, challenges remain in the field. Obstacles include uncertain project contracts, time constraints, and the perceived size and complexity of requirements documents. Agile development provides a framework for addressing some of these challenges by encouraging iterative requirements refinement and adaptation to evolving stakeholder needs.", "Sustainable development requires ongoing collaboration between business and developers. Agile development, based on the Twelve Agility Principles, prioritizes face-to-face communication and empowers motivated teams to deliver quality products. By reducing the distance between requirements and implementation, agile development overcomes obstacles and provides early value to customers through short RE cycles. However, successful agility requires certain assumptions, including a single stakeholder role, small team size, responsive users, incremental functionality delivery, and minimal prioritization. As a result, non-functional aspects, documentation, and change management may receive less attention, making agility appropriate for projects with limited scope and a high degree of user involvement."]}
